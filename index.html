    <h2>My Name</h2>
    <p>
    Hello! My name is Carmelo "Melodic" Gonzalez.  I go by "Melodic" or "Melo".
    </p>

    <h2>Where I'm From</h2>
    <p>
    I am from the Lonestar State of Texas! I grew up here and really enjoy it as Texas is so large that you can explore its many different landscapes. I have yet to see all of Texas due to its immense size! 
    </p>

    <h2>Education History</h2>
    <p>
    I graduated from Devry University in 2013 with a Bachelor's in Game and Simulation Programming, and recently have been self-teaching via free resources due to my interest in the subject of software development.
    </p>

    <h2>Job Experience</h2>
    <p>
    I have a background in small business ownership / self employment for over the past two decades (since 2001).  The primary business focus has been on providing small business bookkeeping and tax services to clients.
    </p>

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
    I am enjoying the journey so far with Code Fellows! My goal is to learn as much as possible in the field of software development through my journey with Code Fellows! My goals for what's next after 401 will be evolving as I proceed through this journey and consider the many opporutunities out there!
